## üìå Objective
Design and implement a **driver health monitoring system** using biomedical sensors. The system monitors:
- Heart Rate (HR)
- Blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO‚ÇÇ)
- Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
- Core Body Temperature (CBT)
- Stress levels

---

## üß† Motivation
Most traffic accidents result from driver fatigue or undiagnosed medical issues. Traditional safety systems focus on the environment, but this system emphasizes **real-time human-centered monitoring**, potentially preventing accidents before they happen.

## üìè Parameter Estimation Techniques

### 1. **CBT (Core Body Temperature)**
- Estimation via MLX90640 thermal camera.
- Uses **maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)** on temperature frames.
- Output: Mean (ŒºÃÇ) of Gaussian distribution from thermal frames.

### 2. **HR & SpO‚ÇÇ (via MAX30102)**
- HR: Derived using peak detection on filtered IR PPG signal.
  - `HR = (Sampling_Frequency * 60) / Avg_Peak_Interval`
- SpO‚ÇÇ: Computed from Red/IR AC-DC signal ratio:
  - `SpO‚ÇÇ = -45.060*(R^2) + 30.054*R + 94.845`

### 3. **HRV / Hypertension Risk (via MAX86150)**
- Peaks extracted using ensemble methods.
- HRV estimated using:
  - `SDNN = stddev(RR intervals)`
- Low HRV linked with hypertension risk.

### 4. **Stress (via GSR)**
- Measures skin conductance via analog voltage.
- Signal is decomposed using **Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD)** into tonic and phasic components.

## üß™ Results
- All parameters were tested under simulated driving conditions.
- Achieved consistent readings across HR, SpO‚ÇÇ, CBT, HRV, and GSR.
- Displayed outputs live on OLED.
- Stable UART communication ensured real-time data transfer between Arduino and Pi.

## üßæ Codebase Structure

- `arduino_code/`: Reads MAX86150 and GSR data; sends via UART.
- `raspberry_code/main.py`: Central pipeline ‚Äî reads all sensor data, performs estimation, displays results.
- `raspberry_code/modules/`: Contains helper scripts for CBT estimation, HR/SpO‚ÇÇ calculations, SDNN analysis, and GSR processing.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- **Thermal sensor** readings are sensitive to ambient conditions.
- **Motion artifacts** degrade PPG signal quality (MAX30102/86150).
- **Loose sensor placement** affects contact-based readings.
- **GSR variability** due to external humidity/temperature.
- SDNN provides **only an indicative risk**, not a diagnosis.

---

## üìà Future Scope

- Integrate AI-based anomaly detection.
- Add camera-based facial fatigue monitoring.
- Miniaturize the hardware for in-vehicle deployment.
